Functioning prototype (1 per student): 
Code: A functional prototype of your project, submitted as a link to a GitHub repo in the design document. This repo should have at least THREE meaningful commits (excluding initial project setup) and contain all the necessary files to run the project (it must be made using p5.js).

README.md: Each group memberâ€™s GitHub repo must include a detailed and well-designed and formatted README.md file containing:

Instructions on how to interact with the work; e.g. move the mouse slowly over the screen, click the play button and wait for the music to start, load the page and the animation will happen over x number of seconds or whatever is needed to make your code come alive.
Details of your individual approach to animating the group code.
Which did you choose to drive your individual code: audio, interaction, Perlin noise or time.
Which properties of the image will be animated and how; highlighting how it is unique from other group members (i.e. one changes colours, the other component sizes, another reveals only some components at a time, etc.). You will need to work with your group members to make sure your work is sufficiently different from each other.
References to inspiration for animating your individual code; these can be images (still or gifs). How did they influence your submission?
A short technical explanation of how your individual code works to animate the image and any appropriate references.
If you made a lot of changes to the group code, explain it here.
If you use tools and technique from outside the course, explain why you used them and how they work.
If you copy a technique from the Internet, explain how it works, why you used it, and where it came from.
Code comments: Your individual submission should have excellent comments in the code. It will contain all the comments from the group code, and comments for your individual work. For any tools and techniques you use from outside the course (maybe you learned it from reading the MDN docs, or a programming course you did before), add a small comment, and for any tools or techniques you used from existing code (like a you tube tutorial or p5.js example) add a comment with a link to the source.
